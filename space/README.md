# Space

A digital sanctuary for emotional resonance and meaningful silence. This project explores the intersection of human emotion, digital spaces, and the power of absence.

## Philosophy

Space is not just another web application - it's an exploration of digital emotional resonance. It challenges the constant noise of the modern web by creating intentional spaces for:

- **Emotional Expression**: A canvas for sharing feelings without the constraints of traditional social media
- **Resonant Connections**: Finding echoes of similar emotional experiences across the digital void
- **Meaningful Silence**: Embracing the power of absence and the spaces between interactions

## Features

- 🎨 **Infinite Canvas**: A boundless space for emotional expression
- 🔮 **Emotional Embeddings**: Advanced mapping of emotional content to find resonant connections
- 🌌 **Echoes**: Discover content that resonates with your emotional state
- 🕊️ **Silence Protocol**: A unique feature that values and records moments of digital silence

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with styled-components and Framer Motion for fluid animations
- **Backend**: Express.js server with emotional processing capabilities
- **Data Storage**: File-based JSON storage (can be extended to PostgreSQL)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for enhanced emotional understanding (optional)
